Aetheric Machinery is a 1.20.1 GTCEu Pack designed with a pure gregtech focus outside of quality of life additions.

This is a passion project that is currently in what i would consider a very early development state, many things are subject to change.

If you wish to follow along you may do so here, this pack will be released on github as well as on curseforge in later stages of development.
